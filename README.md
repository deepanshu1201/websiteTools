# websiteTools

This is a first try at creating a toolbox to support SEO.

Functions that work (more or less):
- Check links for errors (like 404) and redirects (This is the functionality taken from my other repository "LinkCheck".)
- Create a sitemap of a website (this has still some issues with certain website structures)
- Check if all pages contain the meta-keywords and meta-description. Missing keywords and meta-descriptions that are too long are highlighted.

Work in progress:
- Search all hyperlinks to a specific URL or domain
